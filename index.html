        <h2>📜 Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a final-year graduate from Victoria University specializing in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I have worked with all things data during my studies which has helped me develop technical skills and theoretical knowledge in the data field. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my studies I have demonstrated my ability to meet deadlines and conduct project objectives to achieve personal success. I am currently seeking an opportunity to work in the field of data science as a data analyst/engineer to further my personal career goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of study and work, I spend my free time exploring and producing music. I find joy in cooking and the culinary arts, and I also have a deep obsession with movies. My top 3 favourite directors are Chistopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, and Wes Anderson.
