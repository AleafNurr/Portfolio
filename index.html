        <h2>Who Am I? 📜</h2>
        <p>
          I am a final-year graduate specializing in the field
          of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
          Throughout my academic journey, I have focused
          on various aspects of data, allowing me to
          acquire both technical expertise and theoretical
          knowledge in the data field, as well as the
          software and cloud domains.
        </p>

        <p>
          My academic
          experience has demonstrated my adeptness in
          meeting deadlines and successfully accomplishing
          personal objectives. Currently, I am seeking an
          opportunity to work in the field of data science as
          a data analyst/engineer to further my personal
          career goal of working as a ML/AI specialist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of study and work, I spend my free time
          either exploring and producing music or at the
          gym. I have a passion for the culinary arts and
          enjoy cooking, especially for other people. My
          background in theatre inspired my love of film. My
          top three auteur directors are Christopher Nolan,
          Quentin Tarantino, and Wes Anderson.
